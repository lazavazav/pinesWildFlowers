- Summer of 2022: Committee was formed and we began raising awareness and money for this project.

- Fall of 2022: Raised approximately $600 and purchased 10 cubic yards of compost. We collected cardboard from neighbors and in November invited homeowners to help prepare the site, lay cardboard and spread the compost.

- Early Winter of 2022: applied for a grant to raise more money to progress project further with hopes for the installation of bluebird and bat nest boxes and additional wildflower trails.

- Winter of 2023: Plan and purchase seed for late winter planting. Raise seedlings over winter for spring planting.
